    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Under cool running water, rinse matzo sheets until they are quite wet.
        Set it aside and let sit to soften while you prepare the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a large, preferably nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add
        butter. Once it melts and the foam subsides, break matzo sheets into
        bite-size pieces and add to pan. Saut√© matzo in butter until it browns
        all over, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, salt, and pepper to pan and scramble the mixture until it is
        just set but still light and fluffy, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>Serve matzo brei sprinkled with salt and topped with chives.</li>
    </ol>
